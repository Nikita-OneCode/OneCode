        <h2>Your PC</h2>
        <p>In the modern world of digital technology, it is important to keep your computer working properly. One of the first steps to optimize the system is to clean the trash, which helps free up hard disk space and remove unnecessary files. For deeper cleaning, you can use the clear %temp% folder command, where temporary files are stored that slow down the system. <br> 
            To get a complete picture of the status of your device, consider the information about the PC. It contains important information about the processor, RAM, and graphics card. It is also worth paying attention to the list of installed programs. Regular checking can help to remove unnecessary applications that take up resources. <br>
            Do not forget about the list of connected devices. This can be especially useful for tracking active external devices such as printers and flash drives. <br>
            If necessary, to improve computer performance, turn off the computer and then restart.These simple actions can significantly improve your system's speed by freeing up RAM and refreshing system processes.
